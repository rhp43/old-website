<p class="para2">Building speed can be a major advantage for athletes. In this era, the fastest athletes are being recruited by college coaches in many sports. The faster guys are usually considered as the play makers in sports such as baseball, basketball, football, tennis, track, and even hockey. Speed cannot be coached, but can be improved. Coaches and trainers must understand the correct methods to train their athletes in the right form. Telling athletes to run 50 yard sprints will not increase speed but does increase the chance of injuries. The results will increase depending on how hard the athlete want to work. The first method to increasing speed is strengthening the hamstrings. Before performing the hamstring workouts, it is important to warm the hamstring muscles. When an athleteâ€™s main goal is to increase their speed while training, the correct method of training should be applied. Coaches can use treadmills to help with this task.  Coaches should train their athletes to do build up running at 50 percent, 75 percent , 85 percent, and 95 precent. The running speed should never be increased to 100 percent. By allowing athletes to run constantly at maximum speed, the chances of injury  will increase significantly. The purpose of this method is to increase the stride of the runner. By increasing the stride of the runner, the runner is expanding the hips to gain more ground while running.</P>
