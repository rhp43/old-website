<p class="para2">Good eating habits are the best way to succeed in sports. Athletes must balance their diets to compete at the highest level. Healthy eating habits help athletes with their endurance, increasing muscles, and living a healthy lifestyle. Before any athletic event, athletes should consume carbs for energy. By not consuming carbs before and after workouts, athletes will burn muscle instead of fat. Healthy Foods to eat in the mornings are whole grain bread, cereal, pasta, rice, potatoes, oats, and eggs. Some of these foods like pasta, rice, and potatoes are considered food that give energy. For dinner athletes should consume more protein and vegetables. Protein and vegetables will not weigh heavy on the body especially at night. Healthy foods to consume later in the day are vegetables, chicken breast, steak, lean beef, bake or grilled fish, egg-whites, fruits and low-fat yogurt. Breakfast becomes valuable because the body will be craving for carbs in the mornings for energy.</p>
