<p class="para2">Coaches should teach athletes the proper methods regarding how to hydrate before games and before and after practice. Signs and symptoms of dehydration are dry mouth, feeling over heated, head aches, muscles cramps, and feeling fatigued. Dehydration occurs when the body loses water. Coaches must understand the signs of dehydration, because dehydration can lead to strokes and death. Before participating in practice or sporting events, athletes should check their urine color to verify they are properly hydrated. If the urine is dark yellow, that's the first sign of dehydration. The urine color should be clear or a light yellow color. Athletes should also weigh themselves before and after practice. For every pound that is lost should be replaced with two cups of water. To avoid dehydration, coaches can supplies washable water bottles. This allows athletes to drink throughout the day and not forget to hydrate prior to any athletic event.</P>
